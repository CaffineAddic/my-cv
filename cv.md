Research Experience
------------------

* Registration of Medical Images using Semi-Supervised Learning and Spatial Transformers
	+ Collaborated with Dr. Deepak Mishra (Avionics Department, IIST) and Dr. Marcos Medeiros Raimundo (Information Systems Department, The State University of Campinas, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil) to develop a hybrid spatial transformer-based deep learning technique trained on synthetic and real images for registration of brain MR images.
* Machine Learning Assisted Blind Estimation of In-Band OSNR from Optical Spectra
	+ Developed a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) based model with Dr. Abhishek Anchal (Research Scientist, Systems-Optics, Ribbon Communications) to estimate n-band optical-signal-to-noise-ratio (OSNR) from optical spectra, obtained from a cascaded filter network, achieving a mean square error of 0.0094 dB.
* Complex Valued U-Net for PolSAR Image Segmentation
	+ Summer internship at National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to segment RAW complex PolSAR data with Pauli matrix values as labels using Complex valued U-Net models, analyzing different dropout rates over convolutional layers and their effect on model overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 67.10% without dropout.

Projects
--------

* Few-Shot Image Classification using Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FoMAML)
	+ Developed a few-shot classification method using MAML and FoMAML for classification of Omniglot dataset in PyTorch, comparing their results and finding FoMAML to be 5.05% faster for similar accuracy.
* Schlieren/RGB Flame Images Analyzing Tool based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Wavelet Transform
	+ Developed a FFT-based tool to find dominant frequencies present in a flame and corresponding intensity, identifying pixel locations with corresponding frequency pulsing, and plotting the scalelogram for the location using wavelet transform to provide temporal information.
* Complex Network Analysis of the OPEC Crude Oil Trade Network
	+ Analyzed the global Crude Oil trade using complex network techniques to quantify the global crude oil markets and effects of world events, observing the influence of OPEC as a cartel, and finding a 5.25% loss in the trade network.
* Non-Uniform Combustion Temperature Estimation using Laser Absorption Spectroscopy and Multi-Output Gaussian Process Regression
	+ Developed a novel method for estimating non-uniform temperature profiles in combustion systems using Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (LAS) and Multi-Output Gaussian Process Regression, achieving an average RMSE of 19.9165 in temperature profile and maximum error of 20.0593% in temperature prediction.
